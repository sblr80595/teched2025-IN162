# IN162 -  Real-time data for AI agents: Grounding with event-driven architecture

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 Hands-on Workshop session [IN162 | Real-time data for AI agents: Grounding with event-driven architecture](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1748712252655001fP5Z)  

## Requirements

There are no dedicated requirement for this session. You would be able to execute the excercises by just following the descriptions even if you do not have any experience with **SAP Integration Suite and SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh.** 

However, you will be able to derive more value from this session, if you have some knowledge and understanding of event-driven architectures, namely events, queues, topics, event subscriptions along with SAP Integration Suite, SAP Joule Studio and SAP Build Process Automation Actions.<br/>

You can explore the following **SAP Discovery Center missions** to get started and build expertise with the SAP BTP services used in this hands-on workshop session.

* [SAP Integration Suite](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/integration-suite)
* [SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/advanced-event-mesh)
* [SAP AI Launchpad](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-ai-launchpad)
* [SAP AI Core](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-ai-core)

* [SAP Build Process Automation](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-build-process-automation)

## Session Overview

This session introduces attendees to the power of event-driven integration pattern to deliver real-time grounding data, equipping AI system's with the latest business context to make informed and accurate decisions

> [!NOTE]  
> AI Grounding is the process of connecting an AI system's abstract knowledge and responses to specific, real-world data and context, reducing "hallucinations" and increasing the reliability and accuracy of its outputs. 

Although AI Grounding is primarily used for unstructured text documents, it can also be extended to real-time structured business objects by embedding key attributes or metadata. This approach helps improve the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of AI responses when dealing with transactional business data.

In this session, we’ll explore how to apply real-time vector grounding by connecting structured data to an LLM using a vector database using **SAP Integration Suite and SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh**. You’ll see how updates to the data can instantly influence the model’s responses, keeping them current and contextually accurate.

By the end of this session, you’ll understand the core principles behind real-time vector grounding, how to design an embedding strategy for structured entities, and how to integrate this into a sample AI workflow.

The following chapter explains the scenario in more detail:
