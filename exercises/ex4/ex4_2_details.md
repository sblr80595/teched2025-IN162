# Exercise 4.2 - Create an Integration Flow from scratch to receive a Support Case creation event, transform into embeddings, and persist to HANA Vector DB
Make sure you come to this exercise after completing the steps in this [README.md](./README.md).

In this exercise, you will build an IFlow from scratch. Please ensure you follow the steps in the exact sequence outlined in this guide.

## Step 1 - Create a new IFlow

1.  In the Artifacts tab, click on 'Add' -> 'Integration Flow'

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-1.png)
<br>
>[!TIP]
>Click Edit button on top right if Add drop down is not visible

2. In the create dialog, name your integration flow as: 'IN162-`000` Support Case Event to Hana Vector DB for AI Grounding' (replace `000` with your assigned user identifier). 

    Click on 'Add and Open in Editor'.
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-2.png)
<br>

3. Now you should see the basic skeleton of the IFlow ready for us to start building upon. 

    Click on 'Edit' to get started.
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-3.png)
<br>


## Step 2 - AEM Sender Adapter to receive events from the Support Cloud system
In this step, we will configure the AEM Adapter to receive events from the Support Cloud System
<br>
1. Connect the 'Sender' system to the 'Start' event by holding and dragging your mouse pointer. 

![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-4-1.png)
<br>

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-4-2.png)
<br><br>

2. A dialog with the different adapters will appear. Select the 'AdvancedEventMesh' adapter.

![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-5.png)
<br><br>

3. Select this newly added Adapter and click on the 'Connection' tab from the properties sheet at the bottom of the screen. Add the following attributes to the 'Sender Connection Details' section.
    | Field | Value |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | Host | tcps://mr-connection-sq0b51wu6s3.messaging.solace.cloud:55443 |
    | Message VPN | teched-2025-europe |
    | Username | solace-cloud-client|
    | Authentication Type | Basic |
    | Password Secure Alias | teched-2025-europe-aem-password |

    
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-6.png)
<br><br>

4.  Next, head over to the 'Processing' tab and enter 'IN162-`000`_Support_Case' in the Queue Name field (replace `000` with your assigned user identifier). 
   
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Refer to [Exercise 1](../ex1/README.md#exercise-14---create-an-additional-queue-and-queue-subscription-in-advanced-event-mesh) where we created this Queue. Confirm that the queue name entered here matches the one defined previously.
   
Set the 'Acknowledgement Mode' to 'Automatic on Exchange Complete'.
   
Leave all other attributes with their default values.

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-7.png)
<br><br>

We are done with the first block. 
>[!TIP]
>Keep clicking 'Save' periodically over the course of this exercise so that you don't lose your work if the browser session were to time out.

## Step 3 - Enrich the data event received from the Adapter
In the next few steps, we will enrich the support case data received from the Adapter and prepare it for further processing.
1. Click on the (+) Add Flow Step button to add a new step.

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-8.png)
<br><br>

2. Select a 'Groovy Script' in the Add Flow Step dialog.
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-9.png)
<br><br>

3. Title this step 
```
Log Support Case Event Payload
``` 
&emsp;&emsp; in the 'General' tab of the property sheet. This step captures and logs the payload received from the AEM Adapter.

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-10.png)
<br><br>

4. Copy the following lines of code and paste them into the script editor window (after clearing out the generated script present in the editor)
    ```groovy
    import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message

    def Message processData(Message message) {
        def body = message.getBody(java.lang.String) 
        def messageLog = messageLogFactory.getMessageLog(message)
        if (messageLog != null) {
            messageLog.addAttachmentAsString('Support Case Event Payload', body, 'application/json')
        }
        return message
    }
    ```
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-11.png)
<br><br>

> [!TIP]
> Click on 'Apply' to save your changes. Notice that you may receive a warning.
> You can ignore the warning and click on 'Close' and move ahead.
> 
> Make sure to save your changes in the main IFlow editor.

5. Next, after the script step, go ahead and add a new flow step.
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-12.png)
<br><br>

6. Look for the 'JSON to XML Converter' step. The default settings of this step are sufficient. No additional settings are needed in the property sheet.

    In this step, we convert the JSON representation of the data event into its XML equivalent to enable easier data extraction later.

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-13-1.png)
<br><br>


>[!TIP]
> Resize the process lane to accomodate new steps, select the process and drag the rectangle to desired size, also move the end step accordingly
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-14-1.png)
<br><br>

7. Next, after this Converter step, go ahead and add a new flow step.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-14-2.png)
<br><br>


8. Select the 'Content Modifier' step in this dialog that pops out.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-14-3.png)
<br><br>

9.  Name this step as 
```
Extract Support Case and Customer ID
``` 
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-14-4.png)
<br><br>

10.  As you may have guessed, we will extract the Support Case & the Customer ID from the XML document's XPath expression. Go to the 'Exchange Property' tab of the property sheet of this step. Click on 'Add' thrice to add three new Properties.
    

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-15-1.png)
<br><br>

11. Copy the values from the table for Property settings.

| Action | Name | Source Type | Source Value | Data Type |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Create | supportCaseID | XPath | `root/data/currentImage/id` | java.lang.String
| Create | customerID | XPath | `root/data/currentImage/extensions/SupportCaseByCustomer` | java.lang.String
| Create | assignedParticipantID | Constant | IN162-`000` (replace `000` with your assiged participant ID)|


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-15-2.png)
<br><br>

## Step 4 - Filter out 'noisy' events and keep your Support Case data clean and accurate
Since we have subscribed to the Support Case Create event, an event will be emitted on the shared topic (`sap/teched/2025/servicecloud/supportcase/created`) each time a participant logs a support case. You may recall this step from [Exercise 1](../ex1/README.md#exercise-14---create-an-additional-queue-and-queue-subscription-in-advanced-event-mesh).

Although each participant has their own Queue subscription, the Topic itself is shared. As a result, your Queue will receive events for support cases created by all participants, which could lead to inaccurate or misleading summarizations. To address this, we will implement additional filtering steps to remove unnecessary 'noise' and ensure the data remains relevant and accurate.

We will now create two processing routes based on the customer ID retrieved from the support case. If the customer ID matches your individual participant ID, the event will be treated as valid and processed further. If it does not match, it will be considered as belonging to another participant and will be filtered out.
1. Add a new Flow step by clicking on the (+) button after the previous content modifier step.  Select the 'Router' step in the presented dialog.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-16.png)
<br><br>

2. Title the step as 
```
Route Customer ID
``` 
&emsp;&emsp; in the General tab of the Property Sheet. Click on the 'search step' text box on the right side of the screen and search for a 'content modifier' step. Click on the (+) next to the step to start adding it.
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-17.png)
<br><br>

3. Place the box below the 'Route Customer ID' step. Title this step as 'Set Custom Status'.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-18-1.png)
<br><br>

4. Click-hold on the 'Connector' button of the router step, drag the connector, and place it on the 'Set Custom Status' content modifier.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-18-2.png)
<br><br>

5. After this second route is created, title it as 'Others'. Mark this as the 'Default Route' by checking the box. 


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-19.png)
<br><br>

6. Click on the first route (titled Route 1) and rename it to 'Assigned'. Click on the 'Processing' tab in the property sheet and set the 'Expression Type' to 'Non-XML' and the condition as `${property.customerID} = ${property.assignedParticipantID}`.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-20.png)
<br><br>

7. Click on the 'Assigned' route and 'Add a Flow Step'.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-21.png)
<br><br>

8. Select 'content modifier' in the 'Add Flow Step' dialog that pops out.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-22.png)
<br><br>

9. Title the content modifier step as 'Set Application ID and Custom Status' in the General tab of the property sheet. 
   
<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-23-1.png)
<br><br>

10. Next, go to the 'message header' tab and 'Add' a header.

<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-23-2.png)
<br><br>
   
11. Set the Header properties as specified below:

    Action : `Create`, Name : `SAP_ApplicationID`, Source Type : `Property`, Source Value : `customerID`.
> [!NOTE]
> The header attribute `SAP_ApplicationID` is a special one. It serves as an application-level correlation identifier. We introduce this to ease out your monitoring tasks. We can filter on this identifier, helping you to efficiently grab the log entry that corresponds to your execution. 
> 


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-24.png)
<br><br>


12. Click on the 'Exchange Property' tab and add a Property as follows.
   
   Action: `Create`, Name: `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus`, Source Type: `Constant`, Source Value: `Successful: Customer ID matched`.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-25.png)
<br><br>

13. Let's turn our attention back to the 'Others' route now. Click on the 'Set Custom Status' content modifier step. Navigate to the 'Exchange Property' tab in the property sheet and 'Add' a Property. Set the attributes for the Property as follows:
    Action: `Create`, Name: `SAP_MessageProcessingLogCustomStatus`, Source Type: `Constant`, Source Value: `Terminated: Customer ID mismatch`.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-26.png)
<br><br>

14. After this, click on the (+) button on the 'Set Custom Status' content modifier to add a new Flow step.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-27.png)
<br><br>

15. Look up and select the 'Terminate Message' step in the 'add flow step' dialog.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-28.png)
<br><br>

16. Title this step as 'Terminate'. This completes the logic for the 'others' route.


<br>![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-29.png)
<br><br>

## Step 5 - Perform a message mapping to cleanse the data 
In this step, we will utilize the 'message mapping' functionality to cleanse the quality of the support case payload from the system. This step is needed to make the demonstration cleaner. We will concatenate and tailor certain files for better readibiilty.

        // Parse the JSON string
        def jsonSlurper = new JsonSlurper();
        def jsonObject = jsonSlurper.parse(body);
        def embeddings = jsonObject.final_result.data.embedding[0];
        
        //Properties
        def properties = message.getProperties();
        def customerID = properties.get("customerID");
        def customerName = "BestRun " + customerID;
        def escapedSupportCaseJson = properties.get("supportCaseJson");
        
        // Build SQL (HANA requires embeddings inline, not as ?)
        def sqlInsertStatement = "INSERT INTO \"DBADMIN\".\"TechEd25_IN162_Table\" (CUSTOMER_ID, CUSTOMER_NAME, TEXT, TEXT_VECTOR) VALUES (\'${customerID}\',\'${customerName}\',\'${escapedSupportCaseJson}\',TO_REAL_VECTOR(\'${embeddings}\'))";

        message.setBody(sqlInsertStatement);

![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-62.png)
<br><br>

11. Proceed to the 'Connection' tab of the property sheet and enter `SAPHANACloud` in the 'JDBC Data Source Alias' box. Note that this data source alias has already been built for you.

![](../ex4/images/ex162-4-63.png)
<br><br>

12. Access to the HANA Database itself is not part of this hands-on exercise, but just for your understadnding here is how the structure for the table `TechEd25_IN162_Table` has been defined in the default `DBADMIN` schema. 
<br><img src="../ex3/images/image107.png" width=80% height=100%>

## Step 8 - Deploying the IFlow

1. Congratulations ! At this point you are done with creating the IFlow. You final model should look like the one pasted in the screenshot below. The deployment status is naturally 'Not deployed' at this point. 
   
    Click on **Save** and then '**Deploy**' button to trigger the deployment.
